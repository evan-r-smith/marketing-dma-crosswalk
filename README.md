# marketing-dma-crosswalk

This is a "simple" repository. There is no code.

If you work in Marketing in the United States, you're familiar with DMAs or "Designated Marketing Areas". If you then try to use digital marketing data from your campaigns, you've likely run into the fact that different platforms call these DMAs different things. 

To clarify: while DMAs are established by Neilsen, and are thus the same, their _names_ can be different depending on the platform, although the geographic bounds of that DMA will be the same. For example, DCM may say **Abilene/Sweetwater** while Meta Platforms (facebook/instagram) say **Abilene-Sweetwater**.

This repository helps with that by providing an Excel file that aligns the DMAs across different platforms. 

**If there is a platform missing that you have data for, please email me at ersmithbusiness@gmail.com to get it added to this public database**
